|HTTP						| TCP 			| 80 						| 0.0.0.0/0							| HTTP							|
|Custom TCP Rule| TCP 			| 8080					| 0.0.0.0/0							| Deep Detect				|
|All Traffic		| All 			| All 					| [Security Group Name]	| Internal Traffic	|
|Custom TCP Rule| TCP 			| 8888-8900			| 0.0.0.0/0							| Deep Detect				|
|SSH						| TCP 			| 22 						| 0.0.0.0/0							| SSH								|
|Custom TCP Rule| TCP 			| 8998-8999			| 0.0.0.0/0							| xfDNN Demo				|

Now under "Instances" you will see your running Test Drive Instance.
If you click on it, it will show you your public IP address you will need to know to access it.

## Connecting to Your Instance
**To access your instance:**
1. Open an SSH client. (find out how to [connect using PuTTY][])
2. Locate your private key file (yourkey.pem).
3. Your key must not be publicly viewable for SSH to work. Use this command if needed:

	`chmod 400 yourkey.pem`

4. Connect to your instance using its Public DNS:

	`yourpublicdns.compute-1.amazonaws.com`

**Example:**

`ssh -i "yourkey.pem" root@yourpublicdns.compute-1.amazonaws.com`


Please note that in most cases the username above will be correct, however please ensure that you read your AMI usage instructions to ensure that the AMI owner has not changed the default AMI username.
If you need any assistance connecting to your instance, please see our [connection documentation][].
