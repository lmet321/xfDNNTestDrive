# Image Classification GoogLeNet v1 Demo

## Introduction
Image classification is one of the most common benchmarks for machine learning. This tutorial will show you how to launch image classification GoogLeNet v1 demo from the test drive. Once the demo is started, you will be able to view the demo and performance of the demo from any internet connected web broswer.


For launching and connecting to instances, [start here][].

1. Connect to F1
2. Navigate to `/xfdnn_testdrive/`
	```
	$ cd xfdnn_testdrive/
	$ ls
	caffe_ristretto  docker                imagenet      OpenBLAS  start_caffe_docker.sh
	deepdetect       exec_caffe_docker.sh  imagenet_val  README    xilinx
	```

3. Execute `./start_caffe_docker.sh` to enter application docker
	```
	$ ./start_caffe_docker.sh
	/opt/caffe_ristretto$
	```
	In this directory you will see:
    - `classify_cat.sh` - Will send four cat images to the FPGA to classify.
    - `caffe_test.sh`   - Will run a number of calls to xfDNN using Caffe.
    - `run _demo.sh`    - Will run a Image Classification Speed of GoogLeNet v1 demo.
    - `kill_demo.sh`    - Will kill the Image Classification.

4. Execute the `./run_demo.sh` script to start the demo
	```
	/opt/caffe_ristretto$ ./run_demo.sh
	Starting demo...
	kill: usage: kill [-s sigspec | -n signum | -sigspec] pid | jobspec ... or kill -l [sigspec]
	Starting producer...
	Starting Web Interface
	```
	Start up of the demo will take a few minutes, but once its complete, the console will start displaying numbers.

5. The demo will display at the following web address:
	"http://yourpublicdns.compute-1.amazonaws.com:8998/static/www/xdnn1.html"

	To get your 'yourpublicdns.compute-1.amazonaws.com' refer to the launching and connecting instructions
	From your browser you will see the running Image Classification Demo:
